####### Executing tasks in an executor that returns a result #######

http://tutorials.jenkov.com/java-util-concurrent/executorservice.html

One of the advantages of the Executor framework is that you can run concurrent tasks that
return a result. The Java Concurrency API achieves this with the following two interfaces:

№1 Callable: This interface has the call() method. In this method, you have to
implement the logic of a periodicallyTask. The Callable interface is a parameterized interface,
meaning you have to indicate the type of data the call() method will return.

№2 Future: This interface has some methods to obtain the result generated by a
Callable object and to manage its state.
In this recipe, you will learn how to implement tasks that return a result and run them
on an executor.
